This was knocked together quickly as a learning exercise on discord bots - please don't judge the code ðŸ˜‚.

## How does it work?
This bot uses Puppeteer to scrape the mint wallet address page - https://nfteyez.global/accounts/3m4nX9M6Cq2WDjdi57Y6QmaQ8ethgJ1pt58pxKGatGSr. 

We store a counter in counter.json to track the highest number minted - every time we see a result on this page with a higher number we post to discord at the channel ID set in index.ts (`TARGET_CHANNEL_ID`) with the image, link to the wallet and the mint number.

## Setup
 - Clone repo
 - `yarn` to install dependencies
 - Add your token to `config.json`. If you're new to discord bots - see https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/how-to-make-a-discord-bot/ to create a bot and then get the token once your bot is created.
 - `yarn run debug` to launch bot

## Donations
Feel free to send some SOL if you found this useful `8XfKd4dD2WW6Su6bQUHiqzgsBDag3xczNKS7aFCAKgU8`.

Or even better - go and spend it on buying your own Lit Jesus!
